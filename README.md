# KerAzsMB - Vanilla WoW Multibox Framework

Works with WoW 1.12

## Intro
This repository contains many prewritten macros to certain classes, making multiboxing life easier.
In it's current state it could be used as a SuperMacro extension.

## How to setup
1. Download the scripts and place them inside you Interface/Addons/SuperMacro folder.
2. Add the following line to the SuperMacro.xml, inside it's <UI> tag:
```
<Include file="KerAzsMB\KerAzs_mb.xml"/>
```
3. Now you can access the functions in the game with macros like this:
```
/script mage_attack_skull()
```
4. enjoy :)

He is my guildmaster, and without him, I wouldn't even know multiboxing exists, and most of these macros are written by him. You can find them [here](https://github.com/KocsiLevente/multibox).
### FurySwipes
A very generous developer, he made the 5mmb which is a similar framework, and from I learnt, and copied a lot. Check it out [here](https://furyswipes.wixsite.com/mysite).
